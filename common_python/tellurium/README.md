# Tellurium Director
These codes provide abstractions for running tellurium

- model.py - Absraction for running and basic analysis of
a single simulation. Features: change parameters, plot residuals.

- experiment\_runner.py - Runs an experiment that involves: (a)
generating synthetic data (adding randomness to a base simulation) and
fitting parameters; (b) running multiple  such experiments.
