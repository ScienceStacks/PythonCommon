Feature - precompute protein concentrations
1. Constructor has argument for file path of mRNA data,
   reads it, and initializes self._df_protein
2. makeProteinConcentrations
   check for presents of _protein.csv file in same path as
       mRNA file
   if not present, calculate protein concentrations and save
       to file
3. initializeODScope
   create self.protein_name
   initialize values of proteins that aren't protein_name
   protein_kinetics_compiled - single entry for the associated protein
4. calcMrnaEstimates
   only 2 values in state vector
